Building the UI for new story form/adding a new story

-Add a form in the HTML for the story. This should initially be hidden.^
-Add a link in the navbar with the text of “submit”.^
-Write a function in nav.js that is called when users click that navbar link. Look at the other function names in that file that do similar things and pick something descriptive and similar.^
-Write a function in stories.js that is called when users submit the form. Pick a good name for it. This function should get the data from the form, call the .addStory method you wrote, and then put that new story on the page.
